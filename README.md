# Titanic Survival Pediction Using Supervised Machine Learning models.
Project Overview:
<ul>
  <li>This is a project to predict the survival of a passenger on the TITANIC Ship.</li>
  <li>Dataset used for this project is <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data" > Titanic - Machine Learning Disaster </a>from Kaggle.</li>
  <li>The dataset containes records of 891 passengers.</li>
  <li>Steps involved in the project are:
    <ul>
      <li>Importing necessary libraries.</li>
      <li>Importing dataset.</li>

<br>The above plot shows the survival comparison of females and males.
<br><br>
In this project, two models have been used for the prediction of the survival of passengers: Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier.

<h3>Conclusion:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Accuracy achieved for Decision Tree Classifier model  : <b>78</b>%</li>
  <li>Accuracy achieved for Random Forest Classifier model  : <b>80</b>%</li>
  <li>For this dataset, Random Forest model has better performance as compared to Decision Tree model.</li>
  </ul>
